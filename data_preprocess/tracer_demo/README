This is a script to calculate the P- and S-wave travel time between any two 
points in a 3D velocity model.

SUBDIRECTORIES:
    1) src - source codes
    2) mod - place to put collected velocity models



RUNNING THE SCRIPT, SIMPLY TYPE './tracer'!
    To do it correctly, you need a velocity model named 'vel3d.mod' under main 
    directory for script to read. Detailed format please refer to the content 
    of the files.



RAY PATH OUTPUT:
    If select 1 for ray path output, two files named P_path.txt and S_path.txt 
    will be generated. Each ray paths in the files are separated by "X".



INPUT DATA FORMAT: 
    You will see the instruction after typing './tracer':
    1) Two-point mode - All you need is simply to input coordinates of any
                        two points. Then it will give you P- and S-wave 
                        calculated travel times on screen. This mode provide
                        a option to output the traced ray paths for P- and
                        S-wave in the file "P_path.txt" and "S_path.txt",
                        repectively.

    2) Two-file mode  - In this mode you need to input two file names for 
                        sources (usually earthquakes) and receivers (usually
                        stations), respectively. Both of them require the
                        source and receiver coordinates in three columns
                        (lon, lat, dep), and can be plural. See chichi.evt 
                        and chichi.sta for examples. An easier way is to 
                        modify the input file and type './tracer < input'
                        to run.

                        OUTPUT FORMAT:
                        In two-file mode, you can further choose the format 
                        of output file.
                        1) ascii 
                        It will output an ascii file 'tt.table', containning
                        eight-column. The column 1,2,3 and column 4,5,6 are 
                        the source and receiver coordinates, and the last two 
                        columns are the calculated P- and S-wave travel times
                        , respecitvely.

                        2) binary
                        It will output a binary file 'tt.bin', which follows 
                        the ascii format to store.
